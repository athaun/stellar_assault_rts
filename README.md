# Stellar Assault - Unity Space RTS

Built as a continuation of an old project during my Game Development class. 
This is a space RTS where you defend your core space station from ever increasing waves of pirates. 
The game is simple due and buggy due to the time constraints of the class, but it is still a fun project and I may come back to it someday.

Requires Unity version 2023.2.5f1.
